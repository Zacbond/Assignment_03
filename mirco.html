	<h2> Microsoft will stop making the Surface 3 in December.</h2>

	<div id="surface1"> 
		Microsoft's Surface 3 has been on the market for over a year with no successor in sight, but it now looks like the lower-cost Windows tablet is on its way out... well, eventually. The company has confirmed to ZDNet that it will stop producing the Surface 3 by the end of December, or more than a year and a half after it hit store shelves. As it stands, the company says that stock is "limited." You might not get the model you want at your preferred store, then.
	</div>

	<div id="surface2">
		Since launching Surface 3 over a year ago, we have seen strong demand and satisfaction amongst our customers. Inventory is now limited and by the end of December 2016, we will no longer manufacture Surface 3 devices.
